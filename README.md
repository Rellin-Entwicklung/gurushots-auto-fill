# Description
This programme uses Python along with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) to automate the tedious *exposure filling* process on [GuruShots](https://gurushots.com/). 

GuruShots is a platform that enables users from around the globe to enter photography competitions. Each competition has a specific topic that users have to stick to. During the competition, users vote for the photos of other users and get increased exposure for their own photos in return. Each user achieves maximum exposure by filling thier exposure meter for a given challenge, increasing the chances of their photos being seen (and voted for) by other users.

# How to Use
In order to use this exposure auto-filler, all you need to do is to add your GuruShots login credentials in the `credentials.py` file and run `python auto_fill.py` from your terminal. 

Any active challenges on your GuruShots profile will have their eposures auto-filled.
